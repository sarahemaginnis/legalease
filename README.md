# LegalEase #

Front end capstone project at Nashville Software School (NSS). This solo project is the culmination of my time in the front-end segment of the NSS full stack web development program.

## Description ##

LegalEase is a productivity tool for law students that keeps case briefs organized and easy to annotate with class notes and incorporate into outlines without extra work.

The amount of reading done in law school is a mountainous mass and case briefs are a necessary study aid that help to encapsulate and analyze the material that law students must digest. The case brief represents a final product after reading a case, rereading it, taking it apart, and putting it back together again. However, the case brief is just the first step in preparing for class discussions and the end-of-semester exam. After the case brief comes the class notes and the course outline.

There is no good way to save, annotate, and track the case briefs and class notes that law students take throughout the semester, until now. LegalEase takes the pain and frustration out of briefing cases, taking class notes, and incorporating them into course outlines. LegalEase is the first online law school case brief note system that not only saves what is important but keeps it organized for you.
