                The materials appearing on LegalEase's web site could include
                technical, typographical, or photographic errors. LegalEase does
                not warrant that any of the materials on its web site are
                accurate, complete, or current. LegalEase may make changes to
                the materials contained on its web site at any time without
                notice. LegalEase does not, however, make any commitment to

              </p>
              <h3>6. Feedback and Idea Submission</h3>
              <p>
                User acknowledges and agrees that User may be providing and
                submitting feedback, statements, suggestions and ideas (“Ideas”)
                in connection with User’s use of the web site or Services to
                LegalEase which LegalEase may use in future modifications of the
                web site, Services, multimedia works and/or advertising and
                promotional materials relating thereto.
              </p>
              <p>
                User acknowledges and agrees that submission of Ideas to
                LegalEase, either orally or in writing, will not in any way
                establish a confidential relationship with LegalEase, nor will
                it place LegalEase in the position of receiving a disclosure in
                trust. LegalEase will not be obligated and makes no commitment
                to treat or maintain Ideas that User submits as confidential. In
                addition, User does not expect any type of payment or
                remuneration from LegalEase for Ideas. User hereby assigns and
                agrees to assign to LegalEase all rights and title in the Ideas
                and the subject matter of the Ideas, including, but not limited
                to, all patents, copyrights, trade secrets or other intellectual
                property rights in or covering the Ideas and the subject matter
                of the Ideas. No obligation is assumed or may be implied on the
                part of LegalEase by receipt or examination of the idea
                submission to use the Ideas, compensate User or otherwise enter
                into another agreement with User.
              </p>
              <h3>7. Links</h3>
              <p>
                LegalEase's Services may contain links to third-party web sites,
                advertisers, services, special offers, or other events or
                activities that are not owned or controlled by LegalEase. We do
                not endorse or assume any responsibility for any such
                third-party sites, information, materials, products, or
                services. If you access any third party web site, service, or
                content from LegalEase, you do so at your own risk and you agree
                that LegalEase will have no liability arising from your use of
                or access to any third-party web site, service, or content.
              </p>
              <h3>8. Site Terms of Use Modifications</h3>
              <p>
                LegalEase may revise these terms of use for its web site at any
                time without notice. By using this web site you are agreeing to
                be bound by the then current version of these Terms and
                Conditions of Use.
              </p>
              <h3>9. Governing Law</h3>
              <p>
                Any claim relating to or arising under or in connection with
                LegalEase's web site shall be governed by the laws of the State
                of Tennessee, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
              </p>
              <h3>10. Arbitration</h3>
              <p>
                In the event that LegalEase has not been able to resolve a
                dispute it has with User after attempting to do so informally,
                both User and LegalEase agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or
                controversy (excluding any LegalEase claims for injunctive or
                other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or
                relating to these Terms and Conditions of Use, or the breach or
                alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding
                arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in
                the city of Nashville, Tennessee, under the commercial rules
                then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. The award
                rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration,
                reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and
                other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the
                arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
                jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as
                preventing LegalEase from seeking injunctive or other equitable
                relief from the courts as necessary to protect any of
                LegalEase's proprietary interests. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN
                THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR
                CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
                PROCEEDING. USER AGREES THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS AND
                CONDITIONS OF USE, USER AND LEGALEASE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT
                TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
              </p>
              <h3>11. Copyright Policy</h3>
              <p>
                The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”) provides
                recourse for copyright owners who believe that material
                appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S.
                copyright law.
              </p>
              <p>
                If User believes in good faith that materials on the LegalEase
                site infringe User’s copyright, User (or User’s agent) may send
                us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access
                to it blocked.
              </p>
              <p>
                The notice must include the following information: (a) a
                physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act
                on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly
                infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to
                have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on
                the Site are covered by a single notification, a representative
                list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is
                claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity,
                and information reasonably sufficient to allow LegalEase to
                locate the material on the site; (d) the name, address,
                telephone number, and email address (if available) of the
                complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party
                has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner
                complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its
                agent, or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in
                the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that
                the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the
                owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.{" "}

              <h3>12. Waiver, Severability & Assignment</h3>
              <p>
                LegalEase's failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of
                its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable,
                then the remaining provisions of these Terms and Conditions of
                Use will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be
                substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. User
                may not assign any of User’s rights under these Terms and
                Conditions of Use, and any such attempt will be void. LegalEase
                may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries,
                or to any successor in interest of any business associated with
                the Services.
